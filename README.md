# CodeWars Katas

This repository contains all CodeWars Katas that I have solved with **Java** language.
I completed them mostly while learning Java.

My CodeWars account: [Ilia Malafeev](https://www.codewars.com/users/IliaMalafeev)

My current progress: 90% on the way to 3 kyu.

My current leaderboard percentile: Top 3.105%

All Katas are devided between folders representing the difficulty level, e.g. 5 kyu or 3 kyu.

Every Kata has a name which corresponds to the original name at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) and can be found on the source.

Every Kata contains:
* **Description** - to easily understand the goal of the task;
* **Main method** - to check if the code is solving the task correctly right in the file;
* **Goal method** - the solution to the Kata, the code Kata challenges you to write.

Some Katas have _UPGRADED ending in the naming, this means that I have refactored/shortened the code in the process of learning something new.
